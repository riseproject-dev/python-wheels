# CLAUDE.md — python-wheels porting playbook

Guidance for adding a new package's riscv64 wheel build to this repo. Written
from the protobuf port; generalized so the next one is faster. Read the
"Gotchas" section before you start — several cost a full ~12-min CI cycle each.

## What this repo does

Builds riscv64 wheels for packages that don't ship them on public PyPI, and
publishes them to `pypi.riseproject.dev`. Each package gets a
`.github/workflows/build-<pkg>.yml`. Wheels are consumed on `ubuntu-24.04-riscv`
self-hosted runners.

## Working process

Given a package to port, the loop is always the same (project-specific inputs —
name, repo, version, upstream build docs — come from the invoking prompt):

1. Branch `<pkg>` from `origin/main` and work in a dedicated git worktree.
2. Add `.github/workflows/build-<pkg>.yml` following the playbook below.
3. Validate locally (gotcha 9), then push to `origin` and open a PR. The
   `pull_request: paths` trigger runs the workflow on the PR branch.
4. Watch CI, triage failures, iterate until every matrix job is green and the
   `publish` job dry-runs cleanly.
5. When the wheels build and tests pass, reply to any review threads, then
   record reusable, project-agnostic learnings back into this file.

## Anatomy of a build-<pkg>.yml

Standard triggers and env (copy from an existing workflow):

```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version: { description: '<pkg> version/tag', required: true, default: '<latest stable>' }
  pull_request:
    paths: ['.github/workflows/build-<pkg>.yml']   # CI runs when you edit the workflow itself

env:
  UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL: https://pypi.riseproject.dev/simple/
  UV_INDEX_STRATEGY: unsafe-best-match
  UV_ONLY_BINARY: ':all:'
  MANYLINUX_RISCV64_IMAGE: quay.io/pypa/manylinux_2_39_riscv64
```

Two build shapes exist in the repo — pick based on the package:

- **sdist → bdist** (see `build-cffi.yml`, `build-protobuf.yml`): job 1 produces
  an sdist and uploads it + exposes `package_version` as a job output; job 2 (a
  matrix over `cp312/cp313/cp314/cp314t`) downloads the sdist, extracts it, and
  runs `cibuildwheel ./extracted`; job 3 publishes.
- **build-from-checkout** (see `build-onnx.yml`): job runs `cibuildwheel` directly
  on an upstream checkout, feeding native deps via `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT`/CMake.

The `publish` job is always the shared action — it dry-runs off `main`, so it's
safe on PR branches:

```yaml
publish:
  needs: [<build jobs>]
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  permissions: { contents: write, pull-requests: write }
  steps:
    - uses: riseproject-dev/python-wheels/actions/publish-wheels@main
      with:
        artifact-pattern: <pkg>-${{ needs.<sdist-job>.outputs.package_version }}-*-manylinux_riscv64
        gitlab-username: ${{ vars.GITLAB_DEPLOY_USER }}
        gitlab-token: ${{ secrets.GITLAB_DEPLOY_TOKEN }}
        gitlab-project-id: ${{ vars.GITLAB_PROJECT_ID }}
        gh-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

`publish-wheels` auto-creates `docs/packages/<pkg>.yaml` from the wheel metadata on
first publish (`ci_scripts/update_doc.py`). Nightly checks and docs are driven off
that YAML, so **a new package needs no manual registration anywhere** — just the
workflow. Don't hand-write the docs YAML unless you need a `comment`/`warning`.

## Porting playbook (do these in order)

1. **Read the upstream project's own build + release docs first.** Find how *they*
   build their wheels and sdist. Don't assume `python -m build` works (see gotcha 1).

2. **Fetch and inspect the real PyPI sdist** to learn its layout and whether it's
   self-contained:
   ```
   pip download <pkg>==<ver> --no-binary :all: --no-deps -d /tmp/x
   tar tzf /tmp/x/<pkg>-*.tar.gz | head -50
   ```
   Then try to build a wheel from it locally (works even on x86/aarch64 — proves
   portability before you burn a riscv CI cycle):
   ```
   pip wheel /tmp/x/<pkg>-*.tar.gz --no-deps --no-build-isolation -w /tmp/out
   ```
   If that succeeds with no special toolchain, the riscv bdist job can be minimal.

3. **Decide where the sdist comes from** (only relevant for the sdist→bdist shape).
   **Always build the sdist yourself from an upstream checkout** — never wire the
   prebuilt PyPI sdist in as the CI build input (fetch it only for the local
   *inspection* in step 2). Use `python -m build --sdist` from the checkout if the
   project supports it; otherwise whatever the project uses (protobuf: Bazel
   `//python/dist:source_wheel`). Heads-up for Rust/maturin projects: a
   locally-built sdist may pin dependencies *differently* than the released PyPI
   sdist — see gotcha 10.

4. **Map the git tag to the Python version** (see gotcha 3). Take the tag as the
   workflow input; derive `package_version` from the built sdist filename.

5. **Identify native deps** the bdist needs at build time. If none are bundled in
   the sdist, add `CIBW_BEFORE_BUILD` to build them in-container (cffi builds libffi
   that way). If the sdist bundles its C sources (protobuf bundles upb/utf8_range),
   no before-build is needed.

6. **Wire up real testing** — mirror how upstream tests its wheels (gotcha 6).

7. **Validate locally, then push** (gotcha 11). Open a PR; the `pull_request` path
   trigger runs CI. Watch, triage, iterate.

## Gotchas (the "wish I knew from the start" list)

1. **Not every project can build an sdist from its git checkout.** protobuf's
   `setup.py` only works from an already-assembled source package — the README says
   so explicitly: the real sdist is produced by Bazel and bundles generated code
   (`*_pb2.py`) + vendored C. Always check upstream docs before assuming.

2. **The PyPI sdist is often self-contained and architecture-independent** — it
   bundles generated sources so building the bdist from it needs **no** codegen
   toolchain, even though building from the repo does. Confirm with the local
   `pip wheel` test in step 2.

3. **Git tag ≠ Python package version.** protobuf tags are `vNN.M` (`v35.1`) but the
   package is `7.NN.M` (`7.35.1`). Never hardcode the version twice. Take the tag as
   input and derive the version from the sdist filename:
   ```bash
   package_version="$(echo "$sdist_name" | sed -En 's/<pkg>-(.+)\.tar\.gz/\1/p')"
   ```

4. **Build arch-independent artifacts on `ubuntu-latest`, not the riscv runner.**
   The sdist and any `py3-none-any` helper wheels don't depend on arch — build them
   once on x86. Only the actual bdist needs `ubuntu-24.04-riscv`. Building a codegen
   toolchain (e.g. protoc via Bazel) on riscv is a dead-end; don't attempt it.

5. **cibuildwheel `{project}` vs `{package}`.**
   `{project}` = invocation dir (`/project`); `{package}` = path passed to CLI
   (`cibuildwheel ./<subdir>` → `/project/<subdir>`). When you pass a subdir,
   **everything in it — including bundled `tests/` — is under `{package}`, not
   `{project}`**. Reference test suites and staged helpers via `{package}`.
   Symptoms: exit **127** (script not found) or exit **4** + `no tests ran` (pytest
   aimed at wrong dir). **Local-repro trap:** `cd <subdir> && cibuildwheel .` makes
   `{project}==subdir` and masks the bug — always invoke from the parent dir.

6. **Running a real test suite through cibuildwheel:**
   - Stage helper files inside the package dir (cibuildwheel copies that tree into
     the container); reference them via `{package}`.
   - `CIBW_TEST_REQUIRES: <deps>` and `CIBW_TEST_COMMAND: bash {package}/.../run.sh`.
   - `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_PASS_LINUX: PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL` + set
     `PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL: https://pypi.riseproject.dev/simple/` so test deps that
     lack riscv64 wheels on public PyPI (e.g. numpy) resolve from our registry
     inside the container. (build-onnx.yml uses the same mechanism.)
   - **Check whether tests ship in the sdist.** protobuf's don't — upstream builds a
     separate `protobuftests` wheel (`py3-none-any`, via Bazel
     `//python/dist:test_wheel`, not published to PyPI) that bundles the `*_test.py`
     files + generated test protos. Build it alongside the sdist on x86, upload it as
     a second artifact, install it in the test step. Then discover+run like upstream:
     ```bash
     tests="$(pip show -f protobuftests | grep _test.py \
       | grep -v -e _pybind11_test.py -e proto_api_test.py \
       | sed 's,[/\\],.,g' | sed -E 's,.py$,,g')"
     rc=0; for t in $tests; do python -m unittest -v "$t" || rc=1; done; exit $rc
     ```
   - Collect **all** failures per run (`|| rc=1`), don't stop at the first — each CI
     cycle is expensive, so surface the whole list. For genuinely-incompatible tests,
     exclude with an explicit justification comment (build-onnx.yml documents its
     skipped `maxpool` test this way).

7. **Heredoc inside a YAML `run: |` block.** YAML strips the common indent, *then*
   bash needs the `EOF` terminator at column 0. Use `<<'EOF'` (quoted) to stop the
   shell expanding `$…` inside the script. Verify by parsing the YAML and checking the
   `EOF` line de-indents to column 0. The `run:` default shell is `bash` on Linux, but
   word-splitting differs from zsh — test shell snippets under real `bash`, not your
   interactive zsh.

8. **Pin Bazel to a version that actually exists.** bazelisk reads
   `USE_BAZEL_VERSION`. I guessed `8.5.2` (doesn't exist) → 404 → instant fail. There
   is no `.bazelversion` at protobuf release tags. Verify a candidate is real before
   pushing:
   ```
   curl -sI https://releases.bazel.build/<ver>/release/bazel-<ver>-linux-x86_64   # want 200
   ```
   Use a version the project's own CI uses (grep their workflows) that satisfies their
   `MODULE.bazel` `bazel_compatibility`. Install bazelisk yourself; don't assume the
   runner has Bazel. Bazel's `system_python` needs a host interpreter, so run
   `actions/setup-python` before Bazel.

9. **Validate before every push**. Cheap local checks that catch the dumb stuff:
   - `python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('<wf>'))"` — YAML parses.
   - `actionlint <wf>` — it runs shellcheck on `run:` blocks too. The only expected
     warning is `label "ubuntu-24.04-riscv" is unknown` (custom self-hosted runner);
     every workflow trips it. Fix everything else (SC2011 `ls|xargs`, SC2129 repeated
     `>>` redirects, etc.) to match repo cleanliness.
   - Simulate shell pipelines against sample input under `bash`.
   - Run the wheel's import/smoke line against a locally-built wheel in a venv.
   - Use docker to run cibuildwheel on riscv64

10. **Rust/PyO3 (maturin) packages — three traps.**
    - **Floating deps in a locally-built sdist.** If upstream gitignores `Cargo.lock`
      (common for libraries), a fresh `python -m build --sdist` re-resolves crates to
      today's latest semver-compatible versions. With `#![deny(warnings)]`, a newly
      deprecated API in a bumped dep becomes a hard compile error. Fix: pin the
      offending crate to the version upstream released against *before* building the
      sdist, so maturin captures it into the bundled lock:
      ```bash
      cargo update -p <crate> --precise <version>
      python -m build --sdist
      ```
      Diagnose: grep CI log for `use of deprecated` / `could not compile`.
    - **Rust toolchain must be installed inside the manylinux container.** If the
      project's `pyproject.toml` has a `[tool.cibuildwheel] before-all` that does this
      (tiktoken does), it's inherited automatically. Otherwise supply it yourself:
      `CIBW_BEFORE_ALL_LINUX: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y`
      and `CIBW_ENVIRONMENT_LINUX: PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin"`. rustup provisions a
      native `riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu` toolchain in the container.
    - **musllinux can't build** — rustup.rs ships no riscv64 musl toolchain. Restrict
      `CIBW_BUILD` to `*-manylinux_riscv64`. PyO3 extensions are generally not abi3, so
      the matrix is per-interpreter `[cp312, cp313, cp314, cp314t]`.

## Environment / auth notes (this WSL setup)

- **Pushing workflow files needs `workflow` scope** on the gh token, else the push is
  rejected ("refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow … without
  `workflow` scope"). Fix: `gh auth refresh -h github.com -s workflow` (interactive).
- `origin` (`riseproject-dev/python-wheels`) is canonical; there is no separate
  `upstream` remote. Branch from `origin/main`.
- Use `gh` extensively for anything requiring access to GitHub.

## PR / CI conventions

- `pr-checks.yml` rejects commits starting with `revertme`/`revert me`/`DO NOT MERGE`
  and validates `Upstream-Status:` headers in added/modified patches under `patches/`.
- Sanity that the `publish` job **dry-ran** on your PR branch (grep its log for
  "Dry run (not on main branch …)"); it should list the wheels it *would* upload
  without uploading.
